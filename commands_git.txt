first fork the remote repo from the GUI 
and then clone it to local, add the upstream for the cloned forked repo , this upstream is nothing but the remote source
and merger it with main and push it to the forked repo from your local.


git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git
cd forked-repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
git remote -v
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main


if any changes are made directly in the github UI and want to pull it tonyou local repo

git pull origin main
to check to see what changed before pulling 
git fetch origin
git diff origin/main

of we have made any local changes and havent committed git might prevent the pull
you can stash your chnages as below

git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
or
commit your local changes before pulling
git add.
git commit -m "your message"
git pull origin main


after doing any chages locall in order to oush to github
we need to run atleast 3 command git add . git commit and git push
so instaed create an alias as below and just run 1 command 

git config --global alias.acp '!f() { git add . && git commit -m "$1" && git push; }; f'

now we can use git acp "your commit message"
once it asks for username and password after that it wont ask.
cred will be stored in ~/.git-credentials file
