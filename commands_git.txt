first fork the remote repo from the GUI 
and then clone it to local, add the upstream for the cloned forked repo , this upstream is nothing but the remote source
and merger it with main and push it to the forked repo from your local.


git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git
cd forked-repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
git remote -v
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
